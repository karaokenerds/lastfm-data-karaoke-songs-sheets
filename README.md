# KaraokeHunt: Song Search & Playlist Builder

Have a great experience singing karaoke, by building the ideal playlist of songs for you and their friends!

Built in collaboration with Karaoke Nerds (https://karaokenerds.com) and the diveBar Karaoke Community (https://discord.gg/diveBar). Come join us! ðŸŽ¤

> :warning: **Please note**: KaraokeHunt is still very much a work in progress - the app is under development in [this repo](https://github.com/karaokenerds/karaokehunt-app) and this repo is just one backend helper component along the way towards that vision!
